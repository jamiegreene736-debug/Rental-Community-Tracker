# CLAUDE.md — Claude Code session primer

**Read [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) first.** It's the shared contract
between me (Claude Code) and Codex, and it documents the load-bearing
design decisions I made in prior sessions — many of which will look
like bugs if I encounter them cold.

## Session checklist

Before making any changes:

1. Read `AGENTS.md` in full.
2. Scan the Decision Log for recent entries (resolved disputes).
3. Check the Load-Bearing Decisions section against the area I'm
   about to touch.

## My role (reminder)

- Feature branches named `claude/<slug>`, push PRs, **never merge to
  `main` myself**.
- Conventional commits (`feat:` / `fix:` / `refactor:`).
- PR body includes *why*, test plan, and "intentional deviations"
  section when I break a pattern on purpose.
- Deploy verification via API smoke tests or Playwright against the
  live Railway URL.

## When to update AGENTS.md

- After resolving a disagreement with Codex or the human — append a
  Decision Log line.
- When I introduce a new load-bearing constraint — add it to the
  Load-Bearing Decisions section in the same PR.
- When I remove/replace a load-bearing decision — replace (don't
  delete) the entry with a note pointing to the new PR.

## Key files

- Architecture pointers are in `AGENTS.md` under "Architecture
  pointers". Don't duplicate them here.
